# SEL_Jornada repository contains four main data streams including climate data table, ECTM (Soil sensor data), Sensor network data, and Flux table data collected over the years at the Jornada Long Term Experimantal Range (LTER) in Jornada, New Mexico United States. The data will be cleaned for analysis and be used to build a shiny app that will fuse the multiple data streams together, enhance visualizations, data discorvery, gap-fill, detect and remove outliers, and other functionalities that the app may be able to perform.
